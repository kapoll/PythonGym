# PythonGym

Hello

This program is written in free time, when I'm not at work or at university. I learn by writing this project

In the future, the program will have features such as:
- user database
- database with food
- database with excercises
- automatic calculated bmi and caloric demand of users
- based on the data, create a diet and training plan for each users
- allow users to writing progress on gym
- compose diets with product that user wants to eat or insert substitutes if someone is allergic to something

There are many ideas for developing this project.
